6. During the boss fight, try to dodge the boss bullet as well as the enemy. Hit the boss on the yellow circle to decrease the boss's health. Once you've killed the boss, you will get 50 points and 10 extra bullets
7. If you hit an enemy or a boss bullet, a typing game will appear. Type all the letters that appear on the screen. If you didn't manage to type until the letters reach the bottom of the screen, you DIE
